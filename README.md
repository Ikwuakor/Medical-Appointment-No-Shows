# Predicting Medical Appointment No Shows

>The following project explores a dataset from Brazil to determine to what extent we can predict whether patients will show up to their medical appointments as scheduled. There are 110,527 medical appointments with 14 associated variables. The target variable is ``no-show``, which records whether the patients show-up or are no-shows to their appointment.
> ### Scholarship variable explanation:
> Bolsa FamÃ­lia (Family Allowance) is a social welfare program of the Government of Brazil, part of the Fome Zero network of federal assistance programs. Bolsa FamÃ­lia provides financial aid to poor Brazilian families.

Patients failing to make their appointments can be quite problematic for medical professionals. From wasted personnel on staff to other patients, who were otherwise available, being scheduled for a later date, missed appointments can be quite disruptive for medical offices. In fact, missed appointments might also be disruptive to the absent patient's own good health! The question is: how do medical professionals combat missed appointments? Is there a way to predict ahead of time who is most likely to miss their appointments? The following analysis could serve as:
+ a method to help Brazilian medical offices anticipate appointment no-shows and subsequently determine whether intervention methods are cost effective.
+ a template for similar investigations across various locations, both inside and outside of Brazil, as well as in other professions where appointments are scheduled (with industry relevant variables).

### Let's check for, and examine, any outliers in our lone continuous variable, $Age$. Let's plot our age variable.

According to our boxplot, there are some outliers on the higher end of our ``Age`` variable. The distribution of ages seem to be fairly well represented across most twenty year ranges, showing a higher frequency around zero years and falling off after 60 years. Let's take a closer look.

> number of Outliers above 1 threshold: 19762

> number of Outliers above 2 threshold: 1746
number of Outliers above 3 threshold: 5
number of Outliers above 4 threshold: 0
